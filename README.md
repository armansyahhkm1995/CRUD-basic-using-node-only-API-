# Basic CRUD with REST API using Node.js
This project is a simple implementation of a REST API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Purpose
- Learn the process of building a basic CRUD system to better understand REST API concepts.
- Gain deeper insight into how CRUD operations can inform UI/UX design decisions, especially for applications requiring these functionalities.

## Features
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
- REST API built with Express.js and Node.js.
- MongoDB as the database.

## Reflections
This project helped me:

- Learn how APIs process and return data.
- Identify the importance of clear and consistent API design for UI/UX purposes.
- Gain confidence in creating backend processes that complement frontend interfaces.
